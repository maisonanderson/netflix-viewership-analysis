          On December 12, 2023, Netflix made history as the first streaming service to release comprehensive viewership data 
          for its entire catalog. This dashboard provides high-level insights into Netflixâ€™s viewership trends from all data 
          releases since the initial publication. Each time this page loads, it checks for new data updates, with the latest 
          release published on {latest_publish.strftime('%B %d, %Y')}. For more details on previous data releases, please 
          refer to the Info section at the bottom of this page, which also includes a list of the key assumptions made during 
          data processing.
