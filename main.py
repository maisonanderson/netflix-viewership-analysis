    On December 12, 2023, Netflix made history as the first streaming service to release comprehensive viewership data 
    for its entire catalog. This dashboard provides high-level insights into Netflix‚Äôs viewership trends since the 
    initial publication. For more details on updating the data source, please refer to the Info section at the bottom 
    of this page, which also includes a list of the key assumptions made during data processing.

    **Data Processing Assumptions:**
    - **Ownership:** Netflix describes "Release Date" as "the premiere date for any Netflix TV series or film." 
    Therefore, titles with a blank "Release Date" are assumed to be licensed content in this dashboard.
    - **Title:** A new column is created to group related seasons and films under a unified title, enabling higher-
    level insights. Titles are grouped using the following criteria:
        - Titles containing a colon (e.g., *Bridgerton: Season 3*)
        - Titles with "//" as a delimiter (e.g., *The Seven Deadly Sins // ‰∏É„Å§„ÅÆÂ§ßÁΩ™*)
        - Titles ending with a single-digit number (e.g., *Despicable Me 2*)
    - **Media:** The H1 2023 dataset did not categorize content between "Film" and "TV." This dashboard categorizes 
    each title based on classifications found in later datasets. If a title's classification is missing, it defaults 
    to "TV" if the title contains the word "season"; otherwise, it is set to "Film."
    - **Runtime:** The H1 2023 dataset excluded "Runtime." This dashboard fills in missing runtime values by matching 
    titles with later datasets; if unavailable, the runtime is set to the average within the Media classification 
    ("Film" or "TV").
